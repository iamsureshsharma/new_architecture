``` A Flutter project to illustrate the project architecture.```

This is a proposed architecture, created after going through the architectures floating in the flutter community

 - feature first
 - layer first
 - MVC
 - MVVM
 - DDD (Domain Driven Design)
 - BloC
 - Stacked
 - Layered
 
> This architecture is **based** on Uncle Bob's `Clean Architecture Concept`, not pure.

For Complex projects` Clean architecture is fine but for the mid-sized project it becomes hectic

this one is in sync with all above-mentioned architecturess

this project has two lib folders `lib` and `lib1`

> lib => `new proposed architecture`
> 
> lib1 => `has clean architecture`
